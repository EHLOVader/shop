# To Do List
The many features I plan on adding to this plugin...

- Allow for inventory "groups". Products need to be able to have multiple groups of inventories. For example, a shirt product might come in multiple sizes, but also in multiple colors as well.

- USPS , FedEx, and UPS shipping calculators.

- Stripe payment processing

- Promotions (buy one get one free, refer a friend, etc...)

- Customer specific coupons to make rewarding frequent customers easier

- "Notify me when this item is restocked" functionality

- Digital goods

- Category nesting

- Customer rating / reviews

- Product tagging and the creation of a "related products" pseudo category
